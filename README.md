# Mailman Customisations

This repository contains all of the customisations to Mailman that TermiSoc use. They are based around Mailman 2.1.11. 

The intention wasn't to mimic the general design used by TermiSoc, but to provide something a little nicer than was already there. You'll find the file names match up to the admin HTML options.

It also doesn't intend to be responsive, or rely on complex CSS. Everything required is contained within each file, so there was a desire to keep it simple. But, it is on a fluid grid.
